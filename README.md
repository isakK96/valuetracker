# React stock tracking app using the AlphaVantage API

I built this as a way to learn more and familiarize myself with using React hooks coupled with 3rd party API's. It was styled using MaterialUI and CSS.

# Things I learned

- Using Debounce to limit API calls is extremely useful in the case of an autocomplete searchbar.
- It's surprisingly hard to find a library with pretty looking charts.
- MaterialUI has a bit of a learning curve but seems well worth to learn.

# Possible things to add/change

- Spinners to indicate loading
- Prettier looking chart library
- Move API code to a proper nodejs backend
